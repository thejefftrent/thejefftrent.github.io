      Jeff Trent has worked in IT for almost 5 years. He has taken many roles in the field from areas in systems administration to general technical support. While he may be young in the field he is confident about his skills and abilities to solve any computer related problem. His computer talents are more than IT: in his free time he likes to code, and in high school he studied graphic design leaving him proficient in Adobeâ€™s Creative Suite and similar software.

      Jeff likes to try new things. Which is maybe why he is such a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to computers. As a core philosophy he believes that experience in one field often benefits another. Jeff has enjoyed his time in IT and is interested in both IT work and development work.
