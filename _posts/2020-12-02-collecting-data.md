###What are you suppose to do when you have a relatively small dataset?

Is it better to try to write a web scraper and get the data easily?
You will probably have to reformat it anyway, so what is the point?
Maybe if the dataset was sufficiently large it would make sense to start scraping some data.
Oh well, I guess I will just spend hours preparing the data anyways.

In my current case I am just compiling a relatively short list of items from the game Hades so it isn't so bad.
If I was expecting the list to be frequently updated, 
or if I was expecting a *really* large dataset it would probably make more sense to write something that would be better.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
