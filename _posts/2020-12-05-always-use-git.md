Git is soooo good. Let me say that again. Git is so good.

Github is great. Free private repositories? Yes please.

There is never a reason to not use git on a project, no matter how small.

- Backup your work
- Revert to previous version
- Work on two different machines
- collaboration

Use git. (or another VCS)
