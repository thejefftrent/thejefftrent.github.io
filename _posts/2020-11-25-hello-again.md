I am going to try to use this very rudimentary system to post some things
 that I learn in day-to-day development. Like all journals expect long gaps.


My goal is everytime I come across a problem or something similar and to write out the
problem and the answer. Maybe it can be a good reference in the future.

Best wishes and good luck future self!
