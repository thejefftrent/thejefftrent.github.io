        Hi, my name is Jeff. I am a tech enthusiast and love to learn new things. Professionally I am working with C++ in embedded systems. I like to try out new technologies with my personal projects or do work in game design and development. I enjoy game development because it is a great mix of so many skills and have enjoyed practicing art, design, sound, music, 3D modeling, and (of course) programming.

      I have worked with computers since I was in high school over a decade ago. I originally did work in graphic design and general IT doing help desk, system administration, and whatever else was needed. I transitioned to a full-time software engineer in 2018 and have been doing it(and loving it!) ever since.

      I am from Idaho and currently live near Boise. I studied Information Technology at BYU in Provo, Utah. I live with my wife, my son, and my dog. We enjoy watching movies, playing games, and spending time with our families.
